Project Name: The WilderBeasts
This website is created for people who are fans of animals as well as music, so I created a fictional website where animals can actuall play music and the band I created is called The WilderBeasts. The WilderBeasts consist of normal animals like a bear and a capybara and mystical creatures like a mushroom cow and a suhi dragon. Its a play on the word beasts where animals are beasts and wilder would mean that they are more unique than other animal bands as they don't just have ordinary creatures but also mystical ones.

Design process:
I chose neutral and dull colours that are easy on the eyes so that users won't be blinded by a really bright background and they will be able to see this website in the dark since its not using a black background. I createed a border to seperate the navigation bar from the body so the user will be able to see where the nav bar ends. My references are in a lighter background this will help users be able to find the images that i use. I wnated the index page to showcase the artists and then have different pages for their locations,albums and frewuently asked questions. I wanted to hide the artist's description pages so that when users find out that there is something hidden behind the images it acts like an easter egg for them.

Features:
I include 5 pages of html code that open the html pages in a new tab when the elements in the nav bar are clicked on. One hidden page behind the artists that I used to link to the artists description page. I would want to implement a fan page feature where they showoff fan art.

Technologies used:
Prettier is a formatting tool I used as an extension of visual studio code.
